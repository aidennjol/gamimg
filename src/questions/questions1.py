# Solve the following with a comment for the answer below

# True or False is
# true 
# True and True is
# true
# (True and False) or True is
# true
# Not False is
# true
# 1 or 0 is
# 1
# not(False or False) and (True or False) is
# true 
# True ^ True is
# false
# (True or False) and 3 > 2 is
# true

# Name each of the operators and explain what they do

# > greater than (eg 5 > 3 = true)
# < less than (eg 3 < 5 = true)
# >= greater than or equal to (eg 3>=3)
# <= less than or equal to (eg 3<=3)
# != not equal to (eg 4 !=2)
# == = compares 2 things and gives true is they are exactly the same (eg true == true solves to {true == true})








# Why do we use if/else/elif statements
# We use if/else/elif statements due to Python using boolean to determine wether things are true or false. 
# The use of if/eles/elif statements are a safeguard against possible bugs, for example unintended data value inputs.



# In your own words why do we gather requirements
# In an ideal workforce, gathering requirements should be left to a competant project manager. 
# However, most of the time the programmer does not live in an ideal workforce, thus it is important to have the skills necesarry to gather requirements independantly.
# Furthermore, having an adept sense of what is and what isn't needed for a project can assist a better outcome for the task as a whole.
