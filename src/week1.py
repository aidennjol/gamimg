# Basic programming cycle
    # Design the code
        # Plan how your gonna approach
        # Gather requirements
        # Think about tools and shit
    # Writing the code
        # Getting the core functionality
        # Scaffolding
        # Minimal Viable Product (how little work can I do and still satisfy the requirments)
    # Correct Syntax Errors
        # Running your code
        # Fixing why it doesnt run or execute
    # Testing the program
        # Test use cases (these are usually part of the requirements that have been gathered)
        # Write unit tests and regression tests
        # Try to break things
        # Fix Bugs (things that dont work as they should/break/you have missed)
    # Rinse and repeat
        # At university this means finishing the core assignment FIRST and then any addition bonus questions second
        # In the workplace this means continuing to add code and build the product until the contract expires or the client is happy


# Pseudocode
# The idea that code can be expressed in laymans terms and you can understand the meaning
#  is an informal language used to develop a programâ€™s design. It has no syntax rules and is not meant to be compiled or executed. 
# EG

# Boolean Expressions
# A boolean expression will either be True (1) or False(Anything but 1, usually 0)
# The bool() function converts ANY value to a true or false where applicable
# Using boolean math, we can solve boolean equations
# Eg
print('\nBoolean Examples')
print(f'True = {True}')
print(f'1 = {bool(1)}')
print(f'False = {False}')

# The basic ones are
# and
print('\nAND examples')
print(f'True and True = {True and True}')
print(f'True and False = {True and False}')
print(f'False and False = {False and False}')

# or
print('\nOR examples')
print(f'True or True = {True or True}')
print(f'True or False = {True or False}')
print(f'False or False = {False or False}')
# an OR only equals true if at least ONE side is true

# not
print('\nNOT examples')
print(f'not True = {not True}')
print(f'not False = {not False}')
# A not always makes its partner the opposite

# ^ XOR (used only sometimes)
print('\nXOR (^) examples')
print(f'True ^ True = {True ^ True}')
print(f'True ^ False = {True ^ False}')
print(f'False ^ False = {False ^ False}')change_me > 5:

    print('The variable has been set to 5')
elif change_me < 5 and change_me > 0:
    print('The variable is less than 5 but greater than 0')
else:
    print('Logically the number must be less than 0')

# A XOR is true if both sides are different

# Boolean can be chained many times to equate to one final answer just like math
# eg
print('Large boolean example')
print(f'(True or False) and True = {(True or False) and True}')
# Just like math the brackets go first
# True or False is solved first (= True)
# The equation then becomes True and True which solves to = True
print(f'not(True and False) or False = {not(True and False) or False}')
# Brackets first (True and False) = False
# New equations is not False or False
# No more brackets, invert the nots
# New equations is True or False
# True or False solves to True

# Conditional Statements
# The reason we use boolean is so python can _sometimes_ execute code depending on whether things are true or false
# We do this using if, else and elif (else if) statements
# change the varible below to get different results
